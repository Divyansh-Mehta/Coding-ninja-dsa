When you pass an array declared as int Array[3] to the function void fun(int array[]), it decays into a pointer to the beginning of the array i.e int *Array;.
We can describe a parameter as int array[3] or int array[6] or even int *array - all these will be equivalent and you can pass any integer array without 
problems.

In case of arrays of arrays (2D arrays), it decays to a pointer to its first element as well, which happens to be a single dimensional array i.e. we 
get int (*Array)[3] - pointer to an array of 3. Specifying the size here is important. If it were not mandatory, there won't be any way for compiler to know 
how to deal with expression Array[2][1]. For example - To dereference that a compiler needs to compute the offset of the item we need in a contiguous block 
of memory (int Array[2][3] is a contiguous block of integers), which should be easy for pointers. If a is a pointer, then a[N] is expanded as 
start_address_in_a + N * size_of_item_being_pointed_by_a. In case of expression Array[2][1] inside a function (we want to access this element) the Array is 
a pointer to a single dimensional array and the same formula applies. The number of bytes in the last square bracket is required to find 
size_of_item_being_pointed_by_a. If we had just Array[][] it would be impossible to find it out and hence impossible to dereference an array element we need.
Without the size, pointers arithmetics wouldn't work for arrays of arrays. What address would Array + 2 produce: advance the address in Array 2 bytes ahead 
(wrong) or advance the pointer 3* sizeof(int) * 2 bytes ahead.
